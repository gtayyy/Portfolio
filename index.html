    <p class="about_me">
        Born and raised just outside of Portland, I was fortunate enough to grow up on a few acres. With plenty of land
        to roam and play, my families home was to go-to place for many of the neighbor kids to go. We would build forts
        in the forest adjacent to our property. As we grew older, we began shoveling dirt in an area of our property to
        make BMX jumps. BMX bikes led to motorcycles and going to local dirtbike races on the weekends.

        During my time in high school I had the chance to attend an extension school which allowed me the opportunity to
        take part in a graphic design focused curriculm. It was here that I found a true joy in front-end design and
        beginning design concepts. While I had the mindset to pursue this further as I entered college, ultimately I
        changed course of degree. Now at this stage in life, looking to come back to the tech industry, I genuinely
        regret the decision to pursue other avenues for reasons that weren't my own.

        This is now my time. Now I feel free. Welcome to my porfolio.
